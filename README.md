# Calculator
A simple calculator that can calculate mathematical expressions

## How it works
a string is provided in the file called calculator.js.
Calculator.js imports stack.js and toPrefix.js to be used for the calculation.
Calculator.js first converts the string to array, while
toPrefix.js converts the given array to prefix, ready for mathetical operation.
The real calculation is done in the file called stack.js.

## How to use
1. clone the repo
2. mathematical expression is provided as a string and stored in the ques variable(line 5) found in the calculator.js file.
3. run 'node calculator' on the command line without the quotation marks
4. the code comes with example string to test the app. User can simple perform step 3 and the app will still work fine.

## Features to improve
Due to time constraint, parenthesis was not considered.
Another function could be created to open a command prompt to accept users mathetical expression and all the user sees would be the prompt interface tht accepts users input.
guide could had been provided so that when user runs the command 'HELP' on the command line, instructions will display on the terminal and guide the user through on how to use the app.

THE INSTRUCTION FOR THE APP CLEARLY STATED THAT THE PROJECT SHOULD BE DONE WITH PURE JAVASCRIPT.
